# Persian Manuscripts in Cultural Institutions
<p>Originally the aim of this project was to search two cultural heritage institutions, the Walters Museum and the Brooklyn Museum, to isolate objects on a collection level - specifically manuscripts - and then distill this data on an item level.  
A script was written in Python for each museum to pull the relevant data.  
In each the JSON text string was converted to a Python dictionary.  In working with the data, my particular interest was in the percentage of Persian manuscripts in the both museumâ€™s repositories.  
Both Walters Museum and the Brooklyn Museum APIs provide access to their digital records of art.  After this data was gathered, the next step was to write a counter in the script to help count how many total manuscripts there are in the collection, and how many of these are Persian.  
The files are BKM.py and WaltersTest1.py.   </p>


<p>The resulting information can be viewed on the corresponding graphs. </p>


<p>As the project progressed a timeline for each museum - with information obtained from the metadata of the respective scripts of the museums, such as the date made and poets/artists who worked on the object - seemed like a natural fit to visually organize the data. While the samplings were random, I attemped to pull manuscripts from the same time range for both museums - from the 15th century to the 18th century. Further, when possible, I included objects in both timelines from the same poet to highlight the way manuscripts differed aesthetically.  For instance, manuscripts containing text from the poet Firdowsi and (in a separate example) the poet Nizami were in the collection of the Walters Museum and in the Brooklyn Museum, and added to the respective timelines. I found the variations interesting and hope it can be a useful resource to compare the holdings of the museums.  </p>
<p>Two points to note: 1. Each timeline is made up of a random sampling of objects from the respective collections to represent the holdings for each institution. 
2.  Due to the artifactual classification of the manuscripts metadata regarding contributors - poets, caligraphers, and so on- was not available for a few objects.   </p>
