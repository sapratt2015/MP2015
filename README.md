# Persian Manuscripts in Cultrual Instituations
<p>Originally the aim of this project was to search two cultural heritage institutions, the Walters Museum and the Brooklyn Museum, to isolate objects on a collection level - specifically manuscripts - and then distill this data on an item level.  
A script was written in Python for each museum to pull the relevant data.  
In each the JSON text string was converted to a Python dictionary.  In working with the data, my particular interest was in the percentage of Persian manuscripts in the both museumâ€™s repositories.  
Both Walters Museum and the Brooklyn Museum APIs provide access to their digital records of art.  After this data was gathered, the next step was to write a counter in the script to help count how many total manuscripts there are in the collection, and how many of these are Persian.  
The files are BKM.py and WaltersTest1.py.   </p>


<p>The resulting information can be viewed on the corresponding graphs. </p>


<p>As the project progressed a timeline for each museum - with information on the date and place of origin where the object was created - seemed like a natural fit to visually organize the data.  
In addition, I hope it can be a useful resource to compare the holdings of the Walters Museum and the Brooklyn Museum.  Potential points of interest include which poets and artists were contributing to the Persian manuscripts, as well as if certain time periods reflect a greater production rate of these manuscripts.  
Two points to note: 1. Each timeline is made up of a random sampling of objects from the respective collections to represent the holdings for each institution. 
2.  Due to the artifactual classification of the manuscripts metadata regarding provenance was not complete for a few objects.   </p>
